Appending both 'images' and 'images[1]' fields to FormData won't cause a conflict. The server will be able to distinguish between them because they have different names.

When you append fields to a FormData object, each field is associated with a unique name. In your case, 'images' and 'images[1]' are distinct names. The server will receive both fields along with their respective values, and it's up to your server-side code to interpret and handle them appropriately.

For example, if you're using a backend framework like Express.js in Node.js, you can access these fields using their names:

```javascript
app.post("/upload", function (req, res) {
  // Assuming you're using Express.js
  const images = req.body.images; // Access the 'images' field
  const secondImage = req.body["images[1]"]; // Access the 'images[1]' field
  // Further processing...
});
```

If you're using a different backend technology, the method of accessing these fields may vary, but the principle remains the same: access the fields by their names. As long as the names are unique, there should be no conflict.

In JavaScript, object keys are unique; however, FormData objects can handle multiple fields with the same name. When appending fields to a FormData object, if you append multiple fields with the same name, they will be sent as an array-like structure to the server.

For example:

```javascript
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append("images", "image1.jpg");
formData.append("images", "image2.jpg");
```

When you append 'images' field twice as shown above, the FormData object will treat it as an array-like structure. When this FormData object is sent to the server, the server will receive 'images' as an array with both values ('image1.jpg' and 'image2.jpg').

Here's how it behaves when you submit the form:

```javascript
// On form submission
formData.getAll("images"); // Returns ['image1.jpg', 'image2.jpg']
```

So, in this case, there won't be a conflict. The server will receive both values associated with the 'images' field as an array-like structure. If you append 'images' and 'images[1]' as you mentioned earlier, they will be treated as separate fields, not related to each other.
